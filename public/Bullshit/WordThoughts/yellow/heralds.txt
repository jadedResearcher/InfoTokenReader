Al'Daric is a small mageocracy, noted for the Elthin Acadmey, Bellors largest Mage College! Artifacts, spell formulae, and more are produced by this wonderous institution, and through the most powerful magic of all, transmuted into gold! Said powerful magic is trade. They sell them. 
They are led by the mysterious Headmaster, a secretive figure elected by the Councilors of Al Daric. 

Chaos! Violence! Surprisingly little bloodshed! Dun Sancerre has mobilized troops, led by Grand Marshal Giacomo-Henri d'Harcourt, The Dragonslayer, and begun to push down the peninsulas of Al'Daric! Though no open combat broke out, and no towns were sacked, all remain in fear of the Princely and Terrifying Armies!

Fish! Spices! Monster parts! The Rahastan Assembly of Tribes, alongside the merchant princes of Al'Daric, have begun to spread their trade apparatus across the Gold and Green Seas, securing trade routes with their neighbors (even with the mysterious Quotidian Quorum) that they hope to lead to prosperous futures.

Al Daric has completed the construction of its first selection of Pathway networks, linking up the heartlands of the Keitan League with the Acadmey's famed trade routes, bringing obscene amounts of wealth to both nations


Al'Daric continues to establish its pathway network, setting up an Embassy in the Qutoidian town that they have been assured is named 'Embassy' and preparing to establish another one in the newly Keitan-owned Tauhan Lands.
