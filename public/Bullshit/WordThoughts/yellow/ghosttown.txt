Humans. Origin: Al’Daric Bearing: [list abridged for brevity] Offering: [list abridged for brevity], various magical assets, new spell formulae. Result: Protocol Ghost Town successfully executed. New spell formulae have been sent to the academy for dissecting. Formulae mainly focus on minor cosmetic illusions (some form of disguise?
