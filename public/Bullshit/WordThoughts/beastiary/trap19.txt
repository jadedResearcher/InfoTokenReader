Another type of trap is a small wooden box filled with firewood, tied up with string. When a soldier steps on it, he will catch fire and die from the heat. This has been known to take as little as two minutes.

There are other types of traps that have yet to be discovered, such as poisoned darts, but these tend to be more effective against humans than animals.

In addition to all this, there are also the 'tricks' that are used to demoralize and confuse the enemy. These include throwing rocks at them, shooting flares over their heads, setting off fireworks etc. Smoke and noise can also disorientate, as can songs or repetitive chants.
There are a few songs that the command has made popular with the troops. They are meant to boost morale but have the opposite effect, creating an ironic 'camp' song phenomenon. Most of the time, they are played really loudly, to cover up all other noise.
The most well known is probably the 'Harold' song about an obese soldier who was captured by the enemy but managed to kill several of them before he was beaten to death with a rock.
