Fire scrying is exactly what it sounds like—staring into the flames of a fire to see what sort of visions might appear. As with other methods of scrying, this is often very intuitive. By relaxing your mind and focusing only on the flames, you may get messages telling you what it is you need to know.



Watch as the fire flickers and flashes, and look for images in the flames. Some people see clear and specific images, while others see shapes in the shadows, mere hints of what is within. Look for images that seem familiar or for those that may repeat in a pattern. You may even hear sounds as you watch the fire—and not just the crackling of wood, the roar of larger flames, the snapping of embers. Some people even report hearing faint voices singing or speaking in the fire.
