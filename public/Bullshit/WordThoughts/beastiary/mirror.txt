Mirrors are easy to make, and easily transportable, so they’re a very practical scrying tool. Typically, a scrying mirror has a black backing on it, which allows for better reflective properties. Although you can certainly buy one, it's not hard to make your own.


"When you have relaxed completely, work to still your mind from mundane thoughts. See them as tangible objects whirling around you that stop and drop to the floor, then disappear. Make your mind as blank as possible. Focus on the surface of the mirror and the reflections you see from the candlelight and occasional wafts of smoke. Do not strain your eyes to see anything or work too hard. Relax and let it come to you."
When you are finished gazing into the mirror, make sure you have recorded everything you saw, thought and felt during your scrying session. Messages often come to us from other realms and yet we frequently don't recognize them for what they are. It's also possible that you could receive a message that's meant for someone else—if something doesn't seem to apply to you, think about who in your circle could be the intended recipient.
