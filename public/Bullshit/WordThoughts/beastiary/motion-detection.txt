Motion detection is the process of detecting a change in the position of an object relative to its surroundings or a change in the surroundings relative to an object. Detection of Motion can be achieved by either mechanical or electronic methods.[1] When motion detection is accomplished by natural organisms, it is called motion perception.

Motion can be detected by:

Infrared (passive and active sensors)
Optics (video and camera systems)
Radio Frequency Energy (radar, microwave and tomographic motion detection)
Sound (microphones and acoustic sensors)
Vibration (triboelectric, seismic, and inertia-switch sensors)
Magnetism (magnetic sensors and magnetometers)

Current Status: 99.9999% of all motion detectors are not currently functional. Continue maintenance.
