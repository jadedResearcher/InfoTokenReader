In the Old West of the United States, Western false front architecture was often used to create the illusion of affluence and stability in a new frontier town. The style included a tall vertical facade with a square top in front of a wood-framed building, often hiding a gable roof. The goal for the architecture was to project an image of stability and success for the town, while in fact the business owners did not invest much in buildings that might be temporary. Often these towns did not last very long before becoming ghost towns, so businessmen wanted to get started quickly but did not want to spend a lot of money on their stores. Many Western movies feature this kind of architecture because, just like the original buildings, it is quick and cheap to create.

Modern historians are divided on the degree of truth behind the Potemkin village story, and some writers argue that the story is an exaggeration. According to Simon Sebag-Montefiore, Potemkin's most comprehensive English-language biographer, the tale of elaborate, fake settlements, with glowing fires designed to comfort the monarch and her entourage as they surveyed the barren territory at night, is largely fictional.
