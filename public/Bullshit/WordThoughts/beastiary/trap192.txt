Another type of trap is a small wooden box, about the size of a man's fist, filled with dried leaves and grass. When opened it releases a loud noise that can easily be heard over the sound of battle. These are known as 'punga' traps, after the native word for 'grass'. Pungas are very poisonous plants, and the sounds they make when opened can cause severe pain if swallowed. Other types of trap are the common tripwire, smilar to the ones in an M4 minefield, and a simple pitfall.
The common tripwire consists of a thin cable made of fishing line that is stretched across the path. When stepped on, the cable activates a trigger that sets off an alarm, either by releasing a poisonous gas or by firing a trap gun.
The pitfall trap is simply a hole in the ground covered with branches and camouflaged. When tripped, the branches fall into the hole and cover it, making it very hard to actually notice.
