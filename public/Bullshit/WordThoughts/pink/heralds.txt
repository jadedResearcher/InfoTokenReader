The Rahastan Assembly of Tribes is a collection of humble frogmen, lizardmen, and humans based out of the swamp of Rahastas. They have a thriving economy reliant on trade of fruits, fish, and monster parts, and are led by Vulkerath Soot Scale, chosen leader of the Assembly for services rendered, recommended for election by the Speaker (the religious leader of the tribes).
