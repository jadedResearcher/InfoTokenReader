Horrible creatures.

Mudcrabs. What's the point? Annoying buggers, though the meat isn't bad.

I saw a mudcrab the other day.

Horrible creatures. I avoid them whenever I can.

I saw a mudcrab the other day.

I've heard others say the same.

Stop talking!

I saw a mudcrab the other day.

 I avoid those creatures whenever I can.

 Disgusting creatures.

 I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you!

 This could be taken as a serious insult, as mudcrabs are very weak.


 Mudcrabs are large crabs found near almost any body of water and even in sewers.

 They are tough, territorial, and become troublesome in large groups. Individually, they are more of a nuisance than an actual danger. They often conceal themselves in muck or soft soil, causing wanderers to mistake them for rocks. Mudcrabs are typically detected by the loud scuttling of their legs as they move.

 Mudcrabs are particularly known for their weakness and ugly appearance.
