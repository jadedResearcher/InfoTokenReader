Dolphin is a common name of aquatic mammals within the infraorder Cetacea. The term dolphin usually refers to the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the New World river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.

Dolphins are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve.[115] The neocortex of many species is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids.[116] In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment, and theory of mind.[117] Cetacean spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function
