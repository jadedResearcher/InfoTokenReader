The term "feral" can be used to describe those animals that have been through the process of domestication but have returned to a wild state. Domesticated and socialized (tamed) do not mean the same. It is possible for a domestic form of an animal to be feral and not tame, and it is possible for a wild form of animal to be socialized to live with humans.[11]

Feral dogs differ from other dogs because they did not have close human contact early in their lives (socialization).[6] Feral dogs live in a wild state with no food and shelter intentionally provided by humans and show a continuous and strong avoidance of direct human contact.
