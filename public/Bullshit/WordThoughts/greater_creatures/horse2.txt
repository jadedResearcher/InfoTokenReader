This will be the Age of the Horse, Menodoros. We shall ride the world into submission.

MENO: I am sure you will. What will be of me and my people?
SOC: Well, that is a very interesting question. It is said that when men ride horses they cannot look each other in the eye. What then shall become of the meek and humble? The weak? Where will it all end? You must have your own answer to that question.

MENO: Indeed. The world has changed greatly since the days of my ancestors. My people must change with it or perish.
SOC: Yet there is no great hurry. You have been fortunate, Menodoros. You have lived during a time of rare tranquility and peace. You have not fought a single battle in your life. You have rarely experienced hunger, thirst, or cold. All of which are factors of war. All of which contribute to making a man's mind. Your mind is like a strong horse. The more bitter bits you put in its mouth the better. But you must always take care of your horse. Do not let it eat too many pulses or lack grazing, or it may crumble at a bite.

MENO: How can I take care of my horse? Do you have any advice?
SOC: A horse needs only a firm hand. Do not pity your horse. Do not abuse it. It is your faithful servant and companion. It carries you from place to place. Do not throw mud in its eyes. If you do, it may turn against you. Keep it well fed, clean, and strong, and it will serve you faithfully.
MENO: What other advice do you have for me?
SOC: That is all I can offer you, Menodoros. May your horse bring you victory in battle.
