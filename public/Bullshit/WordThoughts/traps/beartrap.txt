Investing is a tricky endeavor, and there are many tricks and traps that the uninitiated can fall into. The bear trap is one of them. A bear trap is a technical pattern that occurs when the performance of a stock, index, or other financial instrument incorrectly signals a reversal of a rising price trend.


The trap is thus a false reversal of a declining price trend. Bear traps can tempt investors to take long positions based on the anticipation of price movements that do not occur.
