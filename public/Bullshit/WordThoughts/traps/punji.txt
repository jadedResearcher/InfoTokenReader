Punji sticks were the most infamous of the booby traps used, said to account for 2% of wounds to [REDACTED] soldiers. They were mostly made out of bamboo (though sometimes metal) in varying lengths and width, and had a simple sharpened spike on one end to impale its victim. Sometimes the sticks were smeared with urine, feces or plant poison to also cause infection.

The sticks were often jammed into camouflaged pits dug in areas likely to be passed through by [REDACTED] troops, which soldiers would then fall in to and become impaled. The point of penetration was usually in the lower leg area, with the sticks not necessarily meant to kill but rather designed to would or slow down a unit whilst victims were evacuated.
