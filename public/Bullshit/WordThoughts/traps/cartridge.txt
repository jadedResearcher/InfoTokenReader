Sometimes known as ‘Toe-poppers’ these were small arms cartridges such as bullets that were placed within a bamboo tube and over a nail, and then camouflaged in the ground with the tip protruding. When stepped on, the pressure placed on the bullet would force it down onto the nail, igniting the primer and exploding.

This created an opportunity for the Viet Cong to ambush whilst the wounded solider was treated. The traps usually wounded, but could be fatal depending on the shell’s size.
