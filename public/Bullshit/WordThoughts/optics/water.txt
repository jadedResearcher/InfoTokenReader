A very popular method of scrying involves the use of water. While this can be a large body of water, such as a pond or lake, many people simply use a bowl. Nostradamus used a large bowl of water as a scrying tool, and put himself into a trance to interpret the visions he saw. Many people also incorporate the reflections of the moon into their scryingâ€”if you're someone who feels more aware and alert during the moon's fullest phase, this might be a good method for you to try!

Water scrying is sometimes referred to as hydromancy. In some forms of hydromancy, the practitioner has a bowl of water in front of them, and then touches the flat surface of the water with a wand to create a ripple effect. Traditionally, the wand is made from the branch of a bay, laurel, or hazel tree, and has resin or sap dried upon the ends. In some practices, the dried sap is run around the edge of the bowl, creating a resonating sound, which is incorporated into the scrying appearance.
