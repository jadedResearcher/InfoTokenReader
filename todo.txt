bUG: text IS working but isn't randomizing what file was chosen on click
(is it because the WordThoughtController isn't rerendering?

-so random sound on click

-make it so it takes in a keyword and grabs BOTH the file list from the keyword and the base level stuff
-make a yellow info token that's just harry potter and discworld
