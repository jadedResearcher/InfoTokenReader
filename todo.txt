BUG: why is it always fire?

its not being chosen. is it react bullshit?

--deep fry images (the util is in, just call it the way thought controller does)
-so random sound on click
-BUG? mist doesn't show up on server (but font does) (doesn't matter if i make it absolute urls...weird)

-make it so it takes in a keyword
-make a yellow info token that's just harry potter and discworld 
-have pink be swamp and witches and necromancers and liches and also ODIN
