-make WordThoughts file, it calls multiple WordThought (instead of shitpost root doing that directly)
    -takes in a file name, loads content (for now mock it)
    -displays it chunked up (no random styling yet)

-print out json loaded from network
-pick a word from the file lists, pass it to WordThoughts
--add a class to FileUtil to load up a file's contents

--do images
-so random sound on click

-make it so it takes in a keyword and grabs BOTH the file list from the keyword and the base level stuff
-make a yellow info token that's just harry potter and discworld
